            <p>An OR gate is a digital logic gate that gives an output of 1 when any of its inputs are 1, otherwise 0.
                An OR gate performs like two switches in parallel supplying a light, so that when either of the switches
                is closed the light is on.</p>

            <p>In its simplest and most common configuration, sudoku consists of a 9 x 9 grid with numbers appearing in
                some of the squares. The object of the puzzle is to fill the remaining squares, using all the numbers
                1-9 exactly once in each row, column, and the nine 3 x 3 subgrids.</p>

            <p>An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms act as an
                exact list of instructions that conduct specified actions step by step in either hardware- or
                software-based routines. Algorithms are widely used throughout all areas of IT.</p>
